# StockPredictionApp
Created a terminal using the LTSM model written in python that predicts the price of an underlying stock based on previous data. The predictions are as close as possible and cannot be relied upon for actual trades. 

If you want to run it, you will have to download all the files, and run it in a Jupyter Notebook.
